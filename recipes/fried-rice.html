                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Nigerian fried rice is a rice dish that’s made with meats, mixed veggies (carrots, peas, sweet corn, green beans) and spices. Like jollof rice, It is a common feature in parties. What makes this recipe authentic is the use of liver as the protein of choice.</p>
                <p>This fried rice is entirely different from the popular Asian Chicken Fried Rice because the depth of the taste in the latter comes from the Soy sauce while the depth of taste of the latter comes from the Curry powder, Thyme, Seasoning cubes, and of course the abundance of vegetables like Carrots, Green beans, Peas, sweet corn, and Onions.</p>
