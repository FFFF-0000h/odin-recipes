This recipe project was curated by The Odin Project (TOP). 
In the process of executing and completing this project, I gained insights into the concept of Brutalist websites and their emphasis on simplicity.

This project was solely developed using vanilla HTML.
Skills Demonstrated:

HTML Fundamentals: I have a solid understanding of HTML basics, including tags, attributes, and the structure of an HTML document.

Semantic HTML: I have used semantic HTML elements appropriately to structure the content of the recipe, making it more accessible and understandable to both humans and search engines.

Text Formatting: I have applied text formatting elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists tags to organize and style the content of the recipe.

Links and Anchors: I have created links to internal resources such as images and pages, to navigate within the recipe document.

Image Embedding: I have embedded images within the recipe to illustrate the appearance of the dish.

Basic Accessibility: I have considered basic accessibility principles, such as using alt attributes for images and ensuring that the content is navigable and understandable for users with disabilities.

Project Organization: I have organized my HTML files and related assets (such as images) in a structured manner within my project directory.

Version Control: I have demonstrated skills in managing and tracking changes to your codebase.
